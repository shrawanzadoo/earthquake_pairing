# Earthquake pairing
Pairing exercise

The below exercise will be used to evaluate your coding style and design decisions:


# Tasks

## Use json earthquake api
Populate the static list with data from the JSON reponse
Each earthquake will occupy one item in the list.
Please populate the attributes from each earthquake to display.

## Highlight strong earthquakes
If the magnitude of the quake is equal or greater than 8, then distinguish these visually from other earthquakes in the list.

## earthquake details
Tapping an earthquake in the list should open a secondary screen with the location depicted on a map.
 
Here's the URL for the earthquake data:
